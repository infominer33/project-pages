I got this Indieweb Jekyll Theme, here:

* [miklb/jekyll-indieweb](https://github.com/miklb/jekyll-indieweb)

I cover most anything you'd need to get started with GitHub Pages in:

* [infominer.id/web-work/github-pages-starter-pack](https://infominer.id/web-work/github-pages-starter-pack)

At the end of that video, we are directed to [Your First Webmention](https://aaronparecki.com/2018/06/30/11/your-first-webmention).

I also found another site that uses this theme:

## [herestomwiththeweather.com](https://herestomwiththeweather.com) 

  * [Jekyll-Indieweb and Micropub](https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2017/11/27/jekyll-indieweb-and-micropub/)

  * [Indieweb Summit 2018](https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2018/06/28/indieweb-summit-2018-thoughts/)

I'm excited too because Tom was at the [IIW where RWoT was first presented](https://herestomwiththeweather.com/2015/10/28/iiw21/), and many others. 

If you're been on this site for very long, you'll notice that I'm quite passionate about [Decentralized Identity](https://infominer.id/DIDecentralized).
